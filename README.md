# Kaggle: "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"

My attempt at the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" challenge on kaggle, available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/leaderboard" >here</a>.

This is by no means an expert or perfect solution, however it does achieve a 75% predicition accuracy using the random forest ensemble learning tenchnique.

This brief report includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and model design.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone this repository.

This jupyter notebook uses the following python packages:
`numpy`
`pandas`
`matplotlib`
`seaborn`
`sklearn`
`statistics`
`warnings`

Output can be seen in the `submissions.csv` file.

## Reflection

This is a project undertaken for fun.

The primary goal of this project was to practice machine learning an data processing techniques in python. This goal has been fully realised.

A better result could definitely be achieved with further analysis and research into the domain, for example the `Cabin` feature in particular could provide more insight.

Ps. Never forget to convert your `float64` to `int64` when using Kaggle!
